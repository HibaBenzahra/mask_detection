# mask_detection
This script is designed to detect and classify shapes in an image of Squid Game masks. Using OpenCV, it identifies black mask regions in the image, finds the contours, and classifies the shapes based on the number of vertices. The shapes are labeled as triangle, square, rectangle, pentagon, or circle, mimicking the iconic masks from the show.
